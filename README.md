# About Us...
Chic_it is an application where you can get an impression of "looks" that people have uploaded, with the option to rent and buy second hand.
Each look is accompanied by information about the items in it. From which store and what is the price.

# Explanation and use of the application..

There are 2 possibilities to enter through 2 different permissions - user and creator.
Creator: Publishes a post (look) to which is attached: description, shop, price and what is its purpose: inspiration, sale, rental as well as the condition of the garment.
User: The ability to look at the app's "home page" and scroll through the feed. Of course, it is possible to search by a certain description, an item of clothing that one is interested in searching for, it is also possible to search by store and by price range.
A profile page where you can edit my details, see the looks I posted and the looks I liked.
To "like" a post, this action adds this look to "looks I liked" and so it can be easily found again through the profile page.
